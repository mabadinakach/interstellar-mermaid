# Interstellar Mermaid

Marcos Scene (Scene 3):
The little mermaid once met a entinty while she was swiming around the universe, this entity had long purple tooth, 3 eyes, 2 red hands and 4 legs, she thought this entity was kind of weird because she was not used to seeing this type of stuff, but what can you expect when you are swiming around the universe...
